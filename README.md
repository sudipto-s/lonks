# Lonks - Link shortener application.


### Exhausted of not getting custom slugs in some popular link shortener applications, I thought of creating my own application. 
### So I made "Lonks" where users can login to their account, shorten links & get a dashboard to manage them.

## Visit [Lonks](https://lonks.onrender.com/)

## What user can do:
### 1. Login/Signup.
### 2. Shorten links with custom slug & set expiry date.
### 3. View, Edit, Share, & Delete links.
### 4. Get a Real-Time click analytics page & know when the shorts are expiring.
