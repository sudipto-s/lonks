# Lonks - Link shortener application.

## Tired of not being able to choose custom slugs on popular link shortener platforms, I decided to build my own application â€” "Lonks".
## It allows users to log into their accounts, shorten links, and manage them easily through a personalized dashboard.

## Visit [Lonks](https://lonks.onrender.com/)

## What user can do:
### 1. Login/Signup.
### 2. Shorten links with custom slug & set expiry date.
### 3. View, Edit, Share, & Delete links.
### 4. Get a Real-Time click analytics page & know when your shorts are expiring.
